/**
 The `TargetAction` class bridges the gap between Swift closures and the common
 Cocoa target (`id`)/action (`SEL`) paradigm. Construct a `TargetAction` with
 a no-argument or single-argument callback closure. Then, use the `target` and
 `action` properties of the `TargetAction` instance as you would normally
 anywhere Cocoa calls for a target/action.
